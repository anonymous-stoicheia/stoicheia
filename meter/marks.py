"""Project macron / scansion annotations onto CharDiff-grc's letter planes.

The backbone codec (data/normalize.py) turns text into per-LETTER planes: every Greek
letter is one position; spaces, punctuation and editorial marks are folded into the
boundary/punct channels or stripped. Both annotation formats mark *letters*:

  macronized text   `_` (long) / `^` (short) written after an ambiguous dichronon,
                    e.g. "βα^ρύκτυ^πος"; combining macron/breve are accepted too
  bracketed verse   [heavy] {light} syllable spans, weight belonging to the last
                    letter of the span, the line-final syllable being verse-end
                    (brevis in longo), e.g. "[ὦ] [παῖ] {τέ}[λος] ..."

So a label is "letter ordinal -> class". We walk the annotated text with the SAME
character-kind LUT the codec uses, counting letters exactly as normalize_record will
count them on the stripped text — projection is alignment-exact by construction and
asserted at encode time.

Label conventions follow the old GreekMacronizer project (its Norma scorer and
scanner corpus are reused verbatim):
  macron: 0 = long, 1 = short
  scan:   0 = none, 1 = heavy syllable ends here, 2 = light ends, 3 = verse ends
